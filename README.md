# Car Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project involves an analysis of a dataset containing information about used cars, specifically the Maruti Alto model. The dataset includes details such as car age, kilometers driven, seller type, fuel type, transmission type, mileage, engine specifications, maximum power, seating capacity, and selling price.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **car_name**: Name of the car model.
- **brand**: Brand of the car (e.g., Maruti).
- **model**: Specific model name (e.g., Alto).
- **vehicle_age**: Age of the vehicle in years.
- **km_driven**: Total kilometers driven by the car.
- **seller_type**: Type of seller (Dealer/Individual/Trustmark Dealer).
- **fuel_type**: Type of fuel used (Petrol/CNG).
- **transmission_type**: Transmission type (Manual/Automatic).
- **mileage**: Mileage in kmpl (kilometers per liter).
- **engine**: Engine capacity in cc.
- **max_power**: Maximum power output in bhp.
- **seats**: Number of seats in the car.
- **selling_price**: Selling price of the car in INR.

## Insights from the Analysis
### Fuel Type Distribution
- The dataset is dominated by cars using Petrol and CNG fuel types.
- Petrol cars tend to have lower mileage compared to CNG vehicles.

### Transmission Type
- All cars in the dataset have manual transmission.

### Mileage Analysis
- Cars running on CNG generally have higher mileage (e.g., 33.44 kmpl) compared to Petrol cars (e.g., 19.7 kmpl).

### Selling Price Trends
- The selling price varies significantly based on vehicle age and kilometers driven.
- Newer cars with fewer kilometers tend to fetch higher prices.

### Seller Type Insights
- Dealers dominate the dataset as sellers, followed by Individual sellers and Trustmark Dealers.

### Engine and Power Specifications
- All cars have a uniform engine capacity of 796 cc but vary slightly in maximum power output depending on fuel type.

## Key Statistics
- **Average Vehicle Age**: Approximately 11 years.
- **Average Selling Price**:
  - CNG Cars: Higher average selling price due to better mileage and fuel efficiency.
  - Petrol Cars: Lower average selling price compared to CNG vehicles.
- **Kilometers Driven Range**:
  - Minimum: ~5,000 km
  - Maximum: ~121,153 km

## Potential Use Cases
This dataset can be useful for:
- Predicting car resale value based on features like mileage, age, and kilometers driven.
- Understanding market trends for used cars.
- Identifying factors influencing car prices for buyers and sellers.

## Limitations
- The dataset is limited to one specific model (Maruti Alto), which may not generalize to other car models or brands.
- Missing values and inconsistencies in data formatting may affect analysis accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- Expanding the dataset to include more car models and brands for broader analysis.
- Addressing missing data points and cleaning the dataset for better insights.

- ## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the resale market of Maruti Alto cars, highlighting key factors that influence pricing and demand. While the dataset offers useful trends, expanding its scope to include multiple car models and brands would allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the used car market. Addressing data inconsistencies and improving data quality will further enhance the accuracy and reliability of future analyses.
